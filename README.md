# Understanding-Magazine-Subscription-Behavior-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Support-Vector-Machine

For this week’s project, we are given the magazine subscribers’ information and behavior data (marketing_dataset.cvs) with attributes of magazine subscriber such as Year_Birth, Education, Marital_status, Income, and response to the offer, etc. To assist magazine company on understanding the decline in last year’s subscription, we are planning to build a model that would help use predict costumers’ subscription behavior (either accepted the offer in the last marketing campaign or not) so that they can utilize marketing expense efficiently to increase subscription rate. 

There are four parts needed to be complete in this assignment:

Part 1:
Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.
Part 2:

Build a logistic model to accurately predict subscription behavior. Discuss which variables are significant, their business impact, and how that may help you learn about the business.

Part 3:
Build an SVM model to accurately predict subscription behavior. Discuss which variables are significant, their business impact, and how that may help you learn about the business.

Part 4:
Compare the accuracy of both models (overall accuracy, precision, recall) and the overall variables that were deemed significant. Discuss which model you would recommend based upon these three metrics.

	Both of these four parts will be completed using Python on Jupyter Notebook. Necessary codes and visuals will be attached directly within this report, and the full python script will be submitted separately in another file.
